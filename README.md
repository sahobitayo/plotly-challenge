# Plotly Challenge
An interactive dashboard that explores [belly button biodiversity](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) and uses a dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Visualizations
The dashboard includes the following visualizations (which were built using Plotly):

1. A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
2. A bubble chart that displays each sample.
3. A gauge chart that shows the weekly washing frequency of the individual selected from the dropdown menu.
4. A panel showing an individual's demographic information with each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object displayed.

All of the visualizations update any time that a new sample is selected from the dropdown menu.

This visualizations were deployed at the following URL: https://sahobitayo.github.io/plotly-challenge/
